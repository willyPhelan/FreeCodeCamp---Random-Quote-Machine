# FreeCodeCamp Random Quote Machine!

## Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://random-quote-machine.freecodecamp.rocks/.

You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning frontend frameworks.
